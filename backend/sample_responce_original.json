The check-in process was quick, and the staff were extremely welcoming. My room was a standard double, spacious, and very clean room  with a full kitchen. Hot and cold breakfast selections were great, and fully stocked each morning, the bed was comfortable.  The hotel location is very calm and quiet.

                        "text": "I lived at this location for 3 years and it was an absolute nightmare. The buildings are extremely old and are constantly under renovation or repair. There is no concern for public health as they do these repairs/renovations with people living in the building and the air systems are never cleaned; tenants are constantly breathing in 20 year old wall dust (lead and arsenic exposure.) Building 2 is infested with rice weevils. There are constant water issues in the units which cause flooding or ceiling damage to other units. These issues are handled by the on site maintenance man who has no experience with mold remediation. There is mold throughout all of the buildings. I was having consistent migraines due to mold exposure. The walls are paper thin without any insulation so you will hear every conversation all of your neighbors are having, you will hear all of their movies and music, and there will always be a cold breeze on your feet because the heat is constantly escaping. If you live on the parking side you will hear garbage trucks and loud music in the morning. If you live on the court side you will hear people playing basketball at 2am and partying in the pool all night in the summer. If you have any kind of noise sensitivity this is absolutely not the community for you. I left this community at lease resigning because the office indicated, through letters, that tenants would need to manually resign leases  to continue being a part of the community. I chose to not resign my lease, I indicated my intent to leave, and provided a forwarding address when handing my keys to Sara in the office. To date, I have never received a certified mail letter with my list of expenses or a reason for deduction of my deposit. I have a $4000 charge that has been added to my credit report, erroneously, as I have never received the proper correspondence from their office. This office is very unprofessional and doesn’t communicate well. If you are having any medical issues while living in these buildings I would speak to your doctor about the potential of exposure to mold and harmful chemicals.",

                        "text": "I lived at this location for 3 years and it was an absolute nightmare. The buildings are extremely old and are constantly under renovation or repair. There is no concern for public health as they do these repairs/renovations with people living in the building and the air systems are never cleaned; tenants are constantly breathing in 20 year old wall dust (lead and arsenic exposure.) Building 2 is infested with rice weevils. There are constant water issues in the units which cause flooding or ceiling damage to other units. These issues are handled by the on site maintenance man who has no experience with mold remediation. There is mold throughout all of the buildings. I was having consistent migraines due to mold exposure. The walls are paper thin without any insulation so you will hear every conversation all of your neighbors are having, you will hear all of their movies and music, and there will always be a cold breeze on your feet because the heat is constantly escaping. If you live on the parking side you will hear garbage trucks and loud music in the morning. If you live on the court side you will hear people playing basketball at 2am and partying in the pool all night in the summer.

After being injured in a car accident, she denied me an appt for 5 weeks & wouldnt even put me on cancellation list. So many unnecessary arguments with her. However the young girls in the office were always kind & helpful.\nDr Falkenstein used to listen to my concerns, but after this accident I was in, he wasn’t the same guy. Tried to tell him I had concussion, a thyroid issue, neck & back injury but he fluffed it off. Got diagnosed many months later  elsewhere by other doctors for all of those things. I took it upon myself to see a specialist who would help with injuries (do injections, nerve block) & Dr. Falkensteins immediate response was to stop treating me with meds for pain so cut me off with no notice (but his office lady lied & tried to tell me he gave me notice).  I went 5 weeks in the most horrific pain & not being able to get out of bed due to the car accident until I could get a pain management doctor to take over.\nMy specialists said any office asst who refused me an appt after car accident injuries & a doctor who missed many important diagnosis’s let alone left me in such horrible pain refusing to continue treating me until pain mgmt could take over were not worth going back to & urged me to find a much better doctor who cared about my well being.",
