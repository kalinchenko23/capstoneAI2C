The check-in process was quick, and the staff were extremely welcoming. My room was a standard double, spacious, and very clean room  with a full kitchen. Hot and cold breakfast selections were great, and fully stocked each morning, the bed was comfortable.  The hotel location is very calm and quiet. The breakfast buffet was varied and delicious,  like coffee, tea, oats, hot chocalate drinks, coffee, fruit drinks, fruits, donuts, begal, bread, (peanut butter, honey, jelly various types )  toaster, microwave, egg boiled and scrambled, cereals, ( 2 types ) waffle machine ( we have to make our own based on our need- the batter is provided).\n\nRoom service provided upon request and they change the towels and set the bed in a friendly way.\nMy daughter was not well, once i request their support they on board and provided full support, espectially my sincere thanks goes to Ms. ANA and the fd guy for their great help.\n\nNo restaurant or stores nearby. But there is a shuttle service available and we can pay 0.25 every trip and need book online / call. which brings us to the nearby shops like taco bell, walmart, aldy, target, IKEA...... Laundry service available by paying 2$ for each washer and dryer.\n\nOverall, I had a great stay and would definitely return, especially for the friendly service and for the price I paid, this was a great value.",

                        "text": "* Comfortable Stay with Excellent Service”\n\n\"I stayed at MainStay Suites Pittsburgh Airport Hotel from 7th Aug to 1st Sep'2024. The check-in process was quick, and the staff were extremely welcoming. My room was a standard double, spacious, and very clean room  with a full kitchen. Hot and cold breakfast selections were great, and fully stocked each morning, the bed was comfortable.  The hotel location is very calm and quiet. The breakfast buffet was varied and delicious,  like coffee, tea, oats, hot chocalate drinks, coffee, fruit drinks, fruits, donuts, begal, bread, (peanut butter, honey, jelly various types )  toaster, microwave, egg boiled and scrambled, cereals, ( 2 types ) waffle machine ( we have to make our own based on our need- the batter is provided).\n\nRoom service provided upon request and they change the towels and set the bed in a friendly way.\nMy daughter was not well, once i request their support they on board and provided full support, espectially my sincere thanks goes to Ms. ANA and the fd guy for their great help.\n\nNo restaurant or stores nearby. But there is a shuttle service available and we can pay 0.25 every trip and need book online / call. which brings us to the nearby shops like taco bell, walmart, aldy, target, IKEA...... Laundry service available by paying 2$ for each washer and dryer.\n\nOverall, I had a great stay and would definitely return, especially for the friendly service and for the price I paid, this was a great value.",

                        "text": "I lived at this location for 3 years and it was an absolute nightmare. The buildings are extremely old and are constantly under renovation or repair. There is no concern for public health as they do these repairs/renovations with people living in the building and the air systems are never cleaned; tenants are constantly breathing in 20 year old wall dust (lead and arsenic exposure.) Building 2 is infested with rice weevils. There are constant water issues in the units which cause flooding or ceiling damage to other units. These issues are handled by the on site maintenance man who has no experience with mold remediation. There is mold throughout all of the buildings. I was having consistent migraines due to mold exposure. The walls are paper thin without any insulation so you will hear every conversation all of your neighbors are having, you will hear all of their movies and music, and there will always be a cold breeze on your feet because the heat is constantly escaping. If you live on the parking side you will hear garbage trucks and loud music in the morning. If you live on the court side you will hear people playing basketball at 2am and partying in the pool all night in the summer. If you have any kind of noise sensitivity this is absolutely not the community for you. I left this community at lease resigning because the office indicated, through letters, that tenants would need to manually resign leases  to continue being a part of the community. I chose to not resign my lease, I indicated my intent to leave, and provided a forwarding address when handing my keys to Sara in the office. To date, I have never received a certified mail letter with my list of expenses or a reason for deduction of my deposit.

                        "text": "I lived at this location for 3 years and it was an absolute nightmare. The buildings are extremely old and are constantly under renovation or repair. There is no concern for public health as they do these repairs/renovations with people living in the building and the air systems are never cleaned; tenants are constantly breathing in 20 year old wall dust (lead and arsenic exposure.) Building 2 is infested with rice weevils. There are constant water issues in the units which cause flooding or ceiling damage to other units. These issues are handled by the on site maintenance man who has no experience with mold remediation. There is mold throughout all of the buildings. I was having consistent migraines due to mold exposure. The walls are paper thin without any insulation so you will hear every conversation all of your neighbors are having, you will hear all of their movies and music, and there will always be a cold breeze on your feet because the heat is constantly escaping. If you live on the parking side you will hear garbage trucks and loud music in the morning. If you live on the court side you will hear people playing basketball at 2am and partying in the pool all night in the summer. If you have any kind of noise sensitivity this is absolutely not the community for you. I left this community at lease resigning because the office indicated, through letters, that tenants would need to manually resign leases  to continue being a part of the community. I chose to not resign my lease, I indicated my intent to leave, and provided a forwarding address when handing my keys to Sara in the office.
