While some customers appreciate the convenience and friendly staff, others express frustration with specific incidents, such as a refusal to exchange expired milk and a lack of enforcement of mask-wearing among customers. The store is noted for its cleanliness and organization, with a selection of items that cater to urgent needs, though prices are considered slightly above average. Overall, the store is seen as a practical option for quick purchases, but improvements in customer service and adherence to health guidelines are recommended.",

I turned to the cashier to exchange for a fresher product, because we are physically unable to drink everything today. The cashier refused (!!!) the child and stated that there is no reason to exchange milk for fresh! Because if you didn't notice when you took it, it's already too late.\nThe child came very upset. I had to get dressed and go. The seller also charged me precisely about the lack of grounds. I had to explain that the buyer's desire and the receipt in hand is all that is needed for the product group to exchange the product immediately at the first request.\nDear \"KOLO\", educate your sellers about the laws of Ukraine and, above all, politeness. Even if the child was wrong, you can't behave like that.",
