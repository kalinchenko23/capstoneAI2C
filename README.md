## Project Overview

The **Special Operations Forces (SOF) Operational Preparation of the Environment (OPE) Toolkit** automates the process of extracting and analyzing Google Maps data for mission-critical intelligence operations. The toolkit reduces the time SOF analysts spend gathering and formatting location data from **days** to **minutes** by leveraging **Google Maps API**, **Large Language Models (LLM)**, and **Vision Language Models (VLM)**.

This cloud-native application, deployed on **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**, provides a web-based user interface for analysts to retrieve structured and georeferenced reports with crucial location information.

---

## Problem Statement

SOF analysts manually extract location-based information from **Google Maps**, requiring **8-40 hours** per request. The process is inefficient, with analysts manually gathering **names, locations, hours of operation, summaries of reviews, and descriptions of photos**.

### Key challenges:
- No automated way to extract and analyze Google Maps data.
- Manual data entry is error-prone and time-consuming.
- The process does not scale well for multiple analysts or urgent requests.

---

## Motivation

**Why build this?**
- Reduce intelligence-gathering time by **90%**.
- Enable real-time, structured data analysis.
- Provide AI-enhanced insights for faster decision-making.
- Improve operational effectiveness with **Excel and geospatial reports**.

**Similar Work:**
- Existing tools require extensive manual effort and lack automated AI-based analysis.

---

## Capacity / Capability Gaps
- No capacity or capability gaps identified at this time.

---

## AI2C Fit:
- This project directly aligns with AI2C / SOF Portfolios guidance for the SOF OPE Toolkit.

---

## RFI's for Customer:
- RFI are handled by the AI2c mentors and by a member of the development team

## Key Features

âœ… **Automated Google Maps Data Extraction** â€“ Uses **Google Maps API** to retrieve places, reviews, and photos.

âœ… **AI-Powered Analysis** â€“ Uses **LLMs** to summarize reviews and **VLMs** to generate image descriptions.

âœ… **Excel & Geospatial Reports** â€“ Outputs data in **Excel** (tabular format) and **KMZ** (georeferenced) formats.

âœ… **User-Friendly Web Interface** â€“ Simple UI for analysts to input locations, bounding boxes, and desired data fields.

âœ… **Secure & Scalable Cloud Deployment** â€“ Hosted on **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)** with **Azure OpenAI services**.

âœ… **Optimized API Calls** â€“ Reduces Google API costs by optimizing query requests using text search parameters.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.9+**
- **Docker**
- **Azure CLI**
- **Kubernetes (kubectl)**
- **Google Cloud API Key**

### Setup Steps
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/kalinchenko23/capstoneAI2C.git
   capstoneAI2C
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment**:
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # MacOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**:
   - Create a `.secrets.json` file and configure the following:
     ```
     GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key
     AZURE_OPENAI_KEY=your_azure_openai_key
     ```

5 **Further instractions are comming later...**

**Testing includes:**
- Google API response validation.
- LLM & VLM output accuracy.
- UI integration tests.
- Performance benchmarks.
